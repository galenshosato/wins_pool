-- Create Drafting Component - DONE

--Create Wins Pool Component
  - Description: User has drafted their teams and should see the cumulative amount of wins amongst their teams
  - Features:
    - see wins by accessing record of the team per year
    - want to know the total amount of wins per week per user (to plot on a graph)
    - Update wins using the espn API
    - *Note* Morgan wants to know which teams won each week (which we can do)

--Create Admin access to Strength of Schedule
  - Plan: Keep track of the records of every team via the ESPN API. Do math on strength of schedule



--TODO--
  -Write a route that will update the weekly win for each user (*Look at this with internet to adjust the winner function based on the ESPN API)
  -Write a unit test for the GET and POST request for /year/week/weekly-wins
  -Write a function that will update the wins for each week from the espn API.
    *Notes* You are thinking too far ahead. One step at a time. Break down each step that needs to happen, write each function, and then fine-tune it later
  -Write route and test to update weekly win, total wins, and record update
